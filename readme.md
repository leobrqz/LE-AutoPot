**A few important notes:**
- While it‚Äôs not a guarantee of survival, it will save you most of the time. It works with any class or build, just make sure you always have enough potions!
- Because of how the game handles health and damage over time (DoT), if you take a lot of DoT or very fast hits, your HP can drop below the threshold very quickly, multiple times or stay below the threshold even with potion drinks.
- The potion will trigger as soon as your real HP drops, but if the accumulated or incoming damage is higher than what a potion can heal, you might still die.
- Be careful with heavy DoT or burst damage‚Äîthere‚Äôs always a chance the damage is more than what a potion can save you from.
